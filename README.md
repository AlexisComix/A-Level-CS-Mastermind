# A-Level-CS-Mastermind
This is a CS project where we make the Mastermind board game. I am going to try different languages and approaches.

## What language will I use?

I have many ideas as to what language I could use for this project, however I feel like they have many different downsides. A language like C/C++ needs low level bindings and such for OpenGl/GLFW, Java is very verbose and I am unfamiliar with LWJGL, Python has very limited scope and speed, and the Rust ecosystem is not fully mature yet for something like making a game. I fear that I will have to make a whole engine for this project.

## HTML/CSS/JavaScript Attempt

First, I tried doing small little graphical demos and such with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am a big fan of the style one is able to achieve with CSS, with the `darkslateblue` to `black` gradients etc., and I do not mind how HTML is formatted. However, I really dislike JavaScript's syntax, and the lack of easy error detection. It is also not very straightforward to make structs/classes, and JavaScript is also unsafe. I want to make a program that is robust, easy to read, write, and modify, as well as good looking and fun on the user's end. Hence, I am ruling out a Web App/JavaScript as an option for this project.

## Rust w/ Bevy Attempt

I tried to start some stuff with Bevy, a rust library for making small graphical games. Bevy itself refused to compile, so I could not go further with it. I also find the way it structures programs to be very confusing.
