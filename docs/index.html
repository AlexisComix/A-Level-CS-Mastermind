                <p id="whatis"> 
                    Mastermind is a board game that, usually, uses coloured pegs and is 
                    played with two players. Comparisons can be drawn to the more modern
                    <i>Wordle</i>, however the game Mastermind has more mathematical complexity
                    behind it as it does not explicitly show which peg or counter (or in the case
                    of Wordle, letter) is correct/in the wrong place.
