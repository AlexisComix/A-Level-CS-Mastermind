                Mastermind is a board game that, usually, uses coloured pegs and is 
                played with two players. Comparisons can be drawn to the more modern
                <i>Wordle</i>, however the game Mastermind has more mathematical complexity
                behind it as it does not explicitly show which peg or counter (or in the case
                of Wordle, letter) is correct/in the wrong place.

                This is the Main Menu and Title Screen. It is navigated by the arrow keys, 
                with option select bound to <i>Z</i> and going back a menu bound to <i>Esc</i>.
                The menu is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. It only shows
                a few options at once for the user, and the indication of the selection is 
                small but clear - deliberately unobtrusive. It contains an option to play the 
                game, an option to see the controls, and an option to exit the game using controls
                inside the game rather than pressing the <i>'x'</i>. The whole application is usable with
                just the keyboard, which works well for this retro-style look. The background
                for the game and its menus was supposed to be a linear mediumseagreen to black
                vertical gradient (like above), however this required me to make my own implementation in 
                Pygame to draw one that uses only two colours and a dithering effect.
                The density of the green per line would decrease with a certain pattern going up.
                However, I likely got the maths or implementation wrong and ended up with this 
                really interesting pattern that resembles a reciprocal function more than it
                does a linear gradient.

                The gameplay for this game is simple. The player places uses the arrow keys to 
                select one of 4 tiles in the row, then uses <i>Z</i> to change the pattern in that
                tile. Once the user is satisfied with that row, they press <i>Enter/Return</i> 
                to submit the row. The row is then compared to a row that was randomly generated at
                the start of the game, and then is scored accordingly. The full square means that the 
                user has a tile in the right place and right pattern, and the blank square means that
                there is a tile in the wrong place. The scoring can sometimes be quite ambiguous, so it
                is up to the user to solve it. 
            </p>
            <p id="whatis">
                Technically, when the row is submitted, a variable that acts like a pointer to the current
                row changes to the next row so then the row in the board that gets changed by the press
                of <i>Z</i> is correct. This means that the previous rows are stored as they were so 
                that they can be drawn to the screen correctly. The scores are also tracked in an array
                like the board, so that the scores do not have to be calculated every frame which could 
                cause unnecessary computation and lower performance.
