                Mastermind is a board game that, usually, uses coloured pegs and is 
                played with two players. Comparisons can be drawn to the more modern
                <i>Wordle</i>, however the game Mastermind has more mathematical complexity
                behind it as it does not explicitly show which peg or counter (or in the case
                of Wordle, letter) is correct/in the wrong place.

                This is the Main Menu and Title Screen. It is navigated by the arrow keys, 
                with option select bound to <i>Z</i> and going back a menu bound to <i>Esc</i>.
                The menu is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. It only shows
                a few options at once for the user, and the indication of the selection is 
                small but clear - deliberately unobtrusive. It contains an option to play the 
                game, an option to see the controls, and an option to exit the game using controls
                inside the game rather than pressing the <i>'x'</i>. The whole application is usable with
                just the keyboard, which works well for this retro-style look. The background
                for the game and its menus was supposed to be a linear mediumseagreen to black
                vertical gradient (like above), however this required me to make my own implementation in 
                Pygame to draw one that uses only two colours and a dithering effect.
                The density of the green per line would decrease with a certain pattern going up.
                However, I likely got the maths or implementation wrong and ended up with this 
                really interesting pattern that resembles a reciprocal function more than it
                does a linear gradient.

                The gameplay for this game is simple. The player places uses the arrow keys to 
                select one of 4 tiles in the row, then uses <i>Z</i> to change the pattern in that
                tile. Once the user is satisfied with that row, they press <i>Enter/Return</i> 
                to submit the row. The row is then compared to a row that was randomly generated at
                the start of the game, and then is scored accordingly. The full square means that the 
                user has a tile in the right place and right pattern, and the blank square means that
                there is a tile in the wrong place. The scoring can sometimes be quite ambiguous, so it
                is up to the user to solve it.

                This is the start for the code for the main game class, Mastermind. This class holds the 
                gameplay logic and the linking together of the drawing functions defined in the class BoxRenderer,
                which I will go into more detail on later. In this class, we start by initialising things necessary
                for the game to start, and then call the main function. This main function handles the inputs
                of the user and does the correct actions based on what the user has done and when. Because this uses
                many different menus, I have used a state system that changes based on what menu has been selected.
                Depending on the state of the game, it will either handle only menu, game, or controls screen inputs and
                drawing functions. The main game class is far too long for my liking, and it does too many things at once.
                It would have been preferred to split it into different subroutines and functions for the sake of 
                abstraction. Functional programming would have been better for this I think as the game is very
                simple and does not need super complex classes and objects. The only thing it is useful for in this 
                implementation is abstraction and not having to pass variables around constantly to drawing functions.
                That would cause messy coupling issues if not done well. I think a system more like C/C++'s header files
                and code files would be appropriate for Python for cases like these, however this is unlikely.

                This is the Box Renderer class as well as the Patterns enum for the whole
                program. This enum just holds abstract variables that just help with the other utilities
                in the program for drawing and game logic etc. The class, <i>BoxRenderer</i> is initialised
                only with the screen to draw on, and then the functions within that object draw to said
                screen using parameters such as the width, height, and x and y position. It made sense to make
                this a class because it reuses the screen variable in the drawing a lot, as well as being
                more abstracted for the programmer. It makes the main game loop and logic easier to read this way.

                The aforementioned background that didn't work as intended that then became a feature is also shown
                above. I forgot the exact maths that I used to try to figure out how to implement the strictly two
                colour linear dithered gradient, but it did not work when implemented and after much tweaking to get
                it to try and work, I got the current background. I like this background more than I would have 
                if it went exactly as I wanted, so I am quite happy with it. I want to then reverse engineer this 
                background function now to some mathematical form so I can compare the two.
